## Hi, I'm Nataliia ğŸ‘‹

Having accumulated over 5 years of commercial experience as a graphic designer, I am adept at utilizing Adobe Creative Suite to transform my creative ideas into reality. Currently, I am actively engaged in full-stack developer training, broadening my expertise to encompass both front-end and back-end development.
